Examples
========

First basic examples
--------------------

These examples show the basic usage of ORCS

Bayesian fitting vs. classical fitting
--------------------------------------

Here are more advanced examples that show step-by-step the differences
between a classical fit and a Bayesian fit on a model spectrum. You
will thus first learn how to model a spectrum and then fit a model
spectrum with one line, two resolved lines and two unresolved lines:
this is when the bayesian fitting algorithm becomes intersting ;)

Calibrating your data
---------------------

A data cube can be recalibrated using mode specific algorithm which
depends on the type of data you have observed. You might want to give
a try to these examples to see if you can get a better calibration for
your data.
