Features
--------

	   
**ORCS** (*Outils de RÃ©duction de Cubes Spectraux*) is an analysis engine for SITELLE_ spectral cubes. With ORCS_ you can:

* extract integrated spectra
  
* fit the sinc emission lines
  
* recalibrate your data in wavelength, astrometry and flux
  
* choose between a Bayesian or a classical fitting algorithm

* and much more ...

**Examples** in Jupyter format can be found in :ref:`examples`.
    
   
.. warning:: ORCS is always in fast development. You might see bugs or
 strange behaviours ! You might also want desperatly to have new
 features. In all cases please send an email:
